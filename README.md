# Microprocessor-Controlled-Prosthetic-Knee
 
This project is aimed to design and implement the control system of a semi active microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee joint. The purpose is to allow lower limb amputees to have a normal walking gait cycle by automatically identifying the gait phase cycles and varying the damping provided by the knee joint. The control system is designed according to the Ottobock C-leg knee to adapt to the walking characteristics of people of weights up to 130 kg and walking speeds of up to 2 m/s. Literature survey and patent research is presented. Requirements, specifications and evaluation criteria are determined. Project planning and management is explained. A morphological chart identifying sub functions and the different concepts generated for each is created. The design uses Fuzzy logic to control the valve opening angles and decision tree algorithm embedded in 2 Raspberry Pi Pico microprocessors to identify the gait phase. The relevant program codes, engineering calculations, analysis, and technical drawings are presented. Detailed discussion and project conclusions are carried out.
